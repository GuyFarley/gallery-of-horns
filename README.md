# Gallery of Horns

This project involves creating an app that displays images and information about various horned creatures. Eventually, it will allow the user to filter the images by number of horns and to choose their favorite image.

# Lab 01 - Creating component structure with React

This went much smoother than I thought it would. I somehow guessed correctly on how to render the image by referencing specific props, but it makes sense to do it this way.

## Feature #1: Display Images

Number and name of feature: Feature #1: Display Images

Estimate of time needed to complete: 1 hour

Start time: 1:30pm

Finish time: 2:10pm

Actual time needed to complete: 40 mins

## Feature #2: Allow users to vote for their favorite beast

Number and name of feature: Feature #2: Allow users to vote for their favorite beast

Estimate of time needed to complete: 1 hour

Start time: 2:15pm

Finish time: 2:45pm

Actual time needed to complete: 30 mins

## Feature #3: Bootstrap

Number and name of feature: Feature #3: Bootstrap

Estimate of time needed to complete: 45 mins

Start time: 2:45pm

Finish time: 5:10pm

Actual time needed to complete: 2.5 hours. Went down a rabbit hole trying to format the page layout with React-Bootstrap, then realized all I needed to do was format the articles themselves.

## Feature #4: Modal

Number and name of feature: Feature #4: Modal

Estimate of time needed to complete: 2 hours

Start time: 12:40pm

Finish time: 2:20pm (Thursday)

Actual time needed to complete: 4 or 5 hours total. I thought I had it complete withing 1.5 hours, but that was with the Modal existing on the App component. Realizing I needed to have a separate SelectedBeast component, it then took me longer to figure out how to pass the data correctly between components to get the Modal to render again.

## Feature #5: Form

Number and name of feature: Feature #5: Form

Estimate of time needed to complete: 3 hours

Start time: 2:20pm

Finish time: 3:50pm

Actual time needed to complete: 1.5 hours
